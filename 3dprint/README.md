3d printed parts should have the original CAD file that generated them, the [.stl file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) for printing, and any dimensioned drawing that exists. If possible, parts should not be longer than 2 hours for one part to print. Larger parts should be broken up into multiple smaller prints or a combination of printed and non-printed parts to avoid overly long prints.

If hardware such as thread inserts, screws and bolts are required to use any given 3d printed part, links to buy those, and photographs or machine drawings of those should also be included in the [README](../readme) file.
