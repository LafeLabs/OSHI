The purpose of Arduino is to make it as easy as possible to build programmable hardware. It is a board with no operating system, which does one thing when it turns on, and then another thing in a loop forever.  

Always post both a link to the file with the code and the code in a code snippet in the [README](../readme/).  Always state any libraries which need to be installed in order to make the Arduino code work.
